# Detecting exoplanets using convolutional neural networks and support vector machine
This repository is connected to a bachelor thesis with the purpose of finding exoplanets with two machine learning algorithms. The bachelor thesis can be found [here](). For this study two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine and convolutional neural networks, where developed and evaluated on a data set to determine which algorithm that performed the best. This project was implemented in pyhton, executing it in Google Colab on a GPU.

### Data set
The data set can be found at a host at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data?fbclid=IwAR04asE3i9QKo9SZru88wCxPsh-EIYYqUUN_8PMu1TdA_k0x5MM1dNg3OPg). It contains time series of light intensity of a star which binary classified in two catagories, "star with no exoplanet in orbit" or "star with an exoplanet in obrit". 
The SVM drive data-folder:

contains all the data sets used for training and testing the SVM model.
